1. Lambda (index.js) accepts 3 environment variables: GIT_TOKEN, WIKI_USER, WIKI_PASS, and calls releasenotes.js

2. create_notes (releasenotes.js) pulls the latest two tags, gets the delta of commit ids, gets the commit messages of these commit ids, discards the "merge" messages and pushes to confluence.

3. Confluence Return codes  
	3.1 200 status is returned for a successful push to confluence.

	3.2 If the page with same title already exists 400 status is returned.

	3.3 If no new commit messages are found, the page is created saying "no changes".

4. Tags should be created immediately after merge in branch with prefix versionx.x. Eg. version0.1, version0.2, version1 etc.
